                <h2>What Is TickyBot</h2>
                <p>TickyBot is a Slack Bot ü§ñ that lets you use support tickets on Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, if you don't feel like it.
                
                With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.
                
                Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <p>You can add TickyBot to your Slack workplace by scrolling down or clicking here
                
                Your users can open a ticket by typing /ticket and their message into the chat field
                
                Once you or another admin solved their problems you can type /ticket close #id to close the ticket</p>
